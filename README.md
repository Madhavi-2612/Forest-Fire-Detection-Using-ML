ðŸŒ²ðŸ”¥ Forest Fire Detection Using Machine Learning
This project leverages machine learning to detect forest fires in real time. The model processes environmental and image data to identify fire outbreaks and triggers an automated email alert with fire images when a fire is detected.

ðŸ”¹ Features
âœ… Fire detection using computer vision & ML algorithms
âœ… Automated email alerts with captured fire images
âœ… Real-time monitoring and detection
âœ… Efficient & accurate identification of fire-prone areas

ðŸ”¹ Technologies Used
Python (OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn)
Machine Learning Models (CNN, Random Forest, etc.)
Email Automation (SMTP, Python's smtplib)
Dataset: Fire & non-fire images for model training
ðŸ”¹ How It Works
The system continuously monitors input images/video feeds.
The ML model classifies images as fire or non-fire.
If fire is detected, an email alert is triggered with the detected fire image.
